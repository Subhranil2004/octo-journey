# Learning Git and Github

Version control is an essential skill for developers to master, and Git is by far the most popular version control system on the web. In this fast-paced course, author Ray Villalobos shows you how to install Git and use the fundamental commands you need to work with Git projects: moving files, managing logs, and working with branches.

Plus, you'll learn how to work with the popular GitHub website to explore existing projects, clone them to your local hard drive, and use them as templates for your new projects.

To launch the website, clone this repo, then go with any of the points:
- Double-click: Double-click the HTML file, and it should open in your default web browser. 
- Right-click and Open with: Right-click the file, choose `Open with`, and select your preferred browser. 
- Code Editor Plugins: If using a code editor like Visual Studio Code, install a plugin like `Live Server` and use the `Open with Live Server` option to launch the file in a browser with automatic updates.
